# team-profile-generator

## Description
This is a command line application that automatically generates an HTML page for your office team with all of the relevant information. It is a simple but powerful application that allows a team manager or other team member to gather all of the information in one place. By simply answering the prompts an HTML card will be generated for all of the chosen employees. Since all teams must have a leader, it starts by prompting the user to enter the information for the team's manager. Upon completing this the user is prompted to choose whether or not they would like to add another employee. Engineers and Interns top the list because there is typically only a single manager, but in case that the user would like to add another Manager that option is included as well. The User can add as many employees as they would like until they click decide to click none at which point all of the entered information will be written to an already formatted HTML file, in the dist file. Ready to go!
